The general benefit of scrolling effects, such as parallax scrolling, lazy loading, and infinite scrolling, is to enhance the user experience by adding visual interest, reducing loading times, and making it easier to consume content. These effects can help keep users engaged and interested in the content, leading to improved retention rates and user satisfaction. Scrolling libraries can also make it easier for developers to implement these effects in their applications without having to write all the code from scratch.
